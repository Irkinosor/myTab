myTab
=====

Change your new tab page, to an informal and great looking page.

The first Open Source New tab Page for Google Chrome! 

What can you do here? 
You can add background images (please check license before), you can add cards (if you are a programmer), you can do bugfixes, and you can add languaes files for your language. 

If you have any questions contact mytab@nickw.de or write a message on github. 

Download myTab here: goo.gl/VRsFZ2 

Have fun! 

btw: you can download this software, but only to change the code. Please upload it again here. And don't steal the code and load up another myTab in the Webstore. Thanks.
